# Straightforward

Javascript Library for More Easier Frontend Development. (exported as a [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) module)

Straightforward is very inspired by [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) and my work experience.


## Build
In Terminal:
```shell
$ yarn run build
```


## Installation

<!--
# CDN build work is in progress. The CDN build feature will be removed from Vite 6. I am looking for another way.
In HTML:
```html
<script src="straightforward.js"></script>
```
-->

Using Javascript UMD:
```js
var stf = require('straightforward');
```

Using Javascript ES:
```js
import stf from 'straightforward';
```


## Why Straightforward?

Straightforward simplifies front-end web development by streamlining operations involving arrays, numbers, objects, strings, and more.
