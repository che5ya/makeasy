# Makeasy.js

Javascript Library for More Easier Frontend Development. (exported as a [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) module)

Makeasy is very inspired by [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) and my work experience.

Makeasy is pronounced [mek-ˈiːzi].


## Build

```shell
$ yarn run build
```
